## User-list
This website will show some users and their informations which are fetched from https://dummyjson.com/users api. Below are the features I added in this app: 
1. Added search user by name functionality.
2. Added sort users by name/ email/ company name functionality.
3. Added a form to add new user.

Additionally, I added react-router-dom to route between web pages.
